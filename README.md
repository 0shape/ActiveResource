#EActiveResource for Yii

...is an extension for the Yii PHP framework allowing the user to create models that use RESTful services as persistent storage.
The implementation is inspired by Yii's CActiveRecord class (http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CActiveRecord/) and the Ruby on Rails implementation of ActiveResource (http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html).

##HINT:
CAUTION: THIS IS STILL AN ALPHA RELEASE!
This project started as a draft and is still under development, so as long is there is no 1.0 release you may experience changes that could break your code. Look at the CHANGES.md file for further information

As there are thousands of different REST services out there that use a thousand different approaches it can be tricky to debug errors. Because of that I added extensive
tracing to all major functions, so you should always be able to see every request, which method it used and how the service responded. Just enable the tracing functionality of Yii
and look for the category "ext.EActiveResource"

##INSTALL:

1.) Add the extension to Yii by placing it in your application's extension folder (for example '/protected/extensions')
2.) Edit your applications main.php config file and add 'application.extensions.EActiveResource.*' to your import definitions
3.) Add the configuration for your resources to the main config

	        'activeresource'=>array(
	        	'class'=>'EActiveResourceConnection',
        		'site'=>'http://api.aRESTservice.com',
                        'contentType'=>'application/json',
                        'acceptType'=>'application/json',
       		)),
       		'queryCacheId'=>'SomeCacheComponent')
       		
4.) Now create a class extending EActiveResource like this (don't forget the model() function!):

##QUICK OVERVIEW:

~~~

     class Person extends EActiveResource
     {
     /* The id that uniquely identifies a person. This attribute is not defined as a property      
      * because we don't want to send it back to the service like a name, surname or gender etc.
      */
     public $id;

     public static function model($className=__CLASS__)
     {
         return parent::model($className);
     }
     
     public function rest()
     {
		 return CMap::mergeArray(
		 	parent::rest(),
		 	array(
		 		'resource'=>'people',
		 	)
		 );
     }

     /* Let's define some properties and their datatypes
     public function properties()
     {
         return array(
             'name'=>array('type'=>'string'),
             'surname'=>array('type'=>'string'),
             'gender'=>array('type'=>'string'),
             'age'=>array('type'=>'integer'),
             'married'=>array('type'=>'boolean'),
             'salary'=>array('type'=>'double'),
         );
     }

     /* Define rules as usual */
     public function rules()
     {
         return array(
             array('name,surname,gender,age,married,salary','safe'),
             array('age','numerical','integerOnly'=>true),
             array('married','boolean'),
             array('salary','numerical')
         );
     }

     /* Add some custom labels for forms etc. */
     public function attributeLabels()
     {
         return array(
             'name'=>'First name',
             'surname'=>'Last name',
             'salary'=>'Your monthly salary',
         );
     }
 }
~~~

##Usage:

~~~

    /* sends GET to http://api.example.com/person/1 and populates a single Person model*/
    $person=Person::model()->findById(1);

    /* sends GET to http://api.example.com/person and populates Person models with the response */
    $persons=Person::model()->findAll();

    /* create a resource
    $person=new Person;
    $person->name='A name';
    $person->age=21;
    $person->save(); //New resource, send POST request. Returns false if the model doesn't validate

    /* Updating a resource (sending a PUT request)
    $person=Person::model()->findById(1);
    $person->name='Another name';
    $person->save(); //Not at new resource, update it. Returns false if the model doesn't validate

    //or short version
    Person::model()->updateById(1,array('name'=>'Another name'));

    /* DELETE a resource
    $person=Person::model()->findById(1);
    $person->destroy(); //DELETE to http://api.example.com/person/1

    //or short version
    Person::model()->deleteById(1);

##Criteria

As of version 0.8 you are able to pass criteria objects/arrays to the finder methods like in ActiveRecord. NOTE: Before that it was a simple params array, so heads up if you updated.
The EActiveResourceQueryCriteria enables you to define your query string in an object oriented way. Therefore you have the following properties that you are
able to define

---

    $criteria=new EActiveResourceQueryCriteria(array(
        'condition'=>'name=:username'
        'limit'=>10
        'offset'=>1
        'order'=>'name'
        'params'=>array(':username'=>'haensel*')
    ));

    //or by directly using the objects properties
    
    $criteria=new EActiveResourceQueryCriteria;
    $criteria->condition='name=:username';
    ....

---

You will probably ask how this will translate to an uri. Good question. Here's an example of using the above criteria with a finder

---

    $criteria=new EActiveResourceQueryCriteria(array(
        'condition'=>'name=:username'
        'limit'=>10
        'offset'=>1
        'order'=>'name'
        'params'=>array(':username'=>'haensel*')
    ));

    $models=User::model()->findAll($criteria);

    //GET to api.example.com/user?name=haensel*&page=1&count=10&order=name

---

"WTF? I never specified 'page' or 'count', so where do they come from?!" By default the "key" for limit=count and the key for offset=page.
The reason for this is that paginators need to know which params to modify in order to create the right requests. Pagination via REST usually works by setting a page + a count parameter in the query string.
If however your API works differently you aren't screwed. You can overwrite these keys by setting them in your "activeresource" component in your main config like

---

    'activeresource'=>array(
        'class'=>'EActiveResourceConnection',
        'site'=>'http://api.example.com',
        'contentType'=>'application/json',
        'acceptType'=>'application/json',
        'limitKey'=>'customLimitKey',
        'offsetKey'=>'customOffsetKey',
        'sortKey'=>'sortKey',
    ),

    //GET to api.example.com/user?name=haensel*&customOffsetKey=1&customLimitKey=10&sortKey=name

---

##Scopes:

As of version 0.8 you are now able to define scopes in your models like you are used to with ActiveRecord. Examples

---

    //default scopes always used with finders
    public function defaultScope()
    {
        return array(
            'condition'=>'published=true'
        );
    }

    public function topTen()
    {
        return array(
            'limit'=>10
            'order'=>'created_at'
        );
    }
    
---

This would cause queries like this

---

    $model=Post::model()->findById(1);
    //GET api.example.com/user/1?published=true

    $model=Post::model()->topTen()->findAll();
    //GET api.example.com/user/1?published=true&order=created_at&count=10

---

##Relations:

As of version 0.8 you are able to define relations via HAS_ONE or HAS_MANY. There are NO BELONGS_TO or MANY_MANY relations as ActiveResource expects the following format for relations
Example: A user has many posts. First we would need to adapt our routes in order to tell ActiveResource how to reach the related posts

---

    public function routes()
    {
        return CMap::mergeArray(
                parent::routes(),
                array(
                    'posts'=>':site/:resource/:id/posts'
                )
        );
    }

    //GET to e.g.: api.example.com/user/1/posts
---

Now we need to define the relation. In this case we need a HAS_MANY relation (in our USER model). The third parameter is the route you specified above

---

    public function relations()
    {
        return array(
            'posts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Post','posts')
        );
    }

    //now somewhere in your app

    $posts=User::model()->findById(1)->posts

    //2 GET reuqests. First to the user with id 1 and second to the posts uri of this user

---

You see, we are effectively ALWAYS using lazy loading. There is no such thing as a JOIN via the with() method!
But what if you only want to get posts that are published? You can pass additional parameters to your relation like this:

---
    public function relations()
    {
        return array(
            'allPosts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Post','posts')
            'publishedPosts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Post','posts','condition'=>'published=:published','params'=>array(':published'=>"true"))
            'sortedPosts'=>array(self::HAS_MANY,'Post','posts','order'=>':order','params'=>array(':order'=>"title"))
        );
    }
